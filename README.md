# code-refactor-accessibility-assgn
In this assignment, I was given code for a company website to refactor for the purpose of making it more accessible for the company website users. 

The accessibility of websites is important for a variety of reasons. Increased accessibility helps all users including people with disabilities to be able to access and work on a give website. It also protects companies avoid litigation in the event that users are not able to access their website.
